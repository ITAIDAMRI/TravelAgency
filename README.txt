Prerequesits:
	The project runs on a localhost, and uses an SQL database.
	You'll need some instance of a localhost - the one used during developement is Apache XAMPP, 
	and is recommended for running the project.
	The project is built with ReactJS for the frontend, and Node-express on the backend.
	Therefore, to run the application, you'll need to have NodeJS installed on your machine.

To run the project - 
	In the XAMPP control menu, click on 'Start" on the "Apache" action column.
	Click next on "Start" on the MySQL action column.
	Open VS Code, open the "Backend" folder, and in the terminal type "npm install", click Enter
	After it finishes, type "npm start", click Enter
	You should see text in the terminal that will say that all the tables have been written in and verified
	Next, in a new VS Code window, open the "frontend" folder. Open the integrated terminal and type "npm install"
	After it finishes, type "npm start". This should start a process and when it's ready - i'll open a browser window 
	with the application.

IF YOU SUMBLE UPON AN ERROR WHILE RUNNING THE BACKEND:
	Just run the same command a couple more times, it will fix the problem.
